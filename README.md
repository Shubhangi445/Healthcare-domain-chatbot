# Healthcare-domain-chatbot
This project is based on Healthcare Chatbot, in which the users/patients tells about their symptoms and disease is predicted by AI. Doctor is recommended to the patient/user with the help of symptoms provided by the patient/user. The project is made in Python language.

######## A Healthcare Domain Chatbot to simulate the predictions of a General Physician ########

# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
training_dataset = pd.read_csv('Training.csv')
test_dataset = pd.read_csv('Testing.csv')

# Slicing and Dicing the dataset to separate features from predictions
X = training_dataset.iloc[:, 0:132].values
y = training_dataset.iloc[:, -1].values

# Dimensionality Reduction for removing redundancies
dimensionality_reduction = training_dataset.groupby(training_dataset['prognosis']).max()

# Encoding String values to integer constants
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
labelencoder = LabelEncoder()
y = labelencoder.fit_transform(y)

# Splitting the dataset into training set and test set
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 0)

# Implementing the Decision Tree Classifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Saving the information of columns
cols     = training_dataset.columns
cols     = cols[:-1]


# Checking the Important features
importances = classifier.feature_importances_
indices = np.argsort(importances)[::-1]
features = cols

# Implementing the Visual Tree
from sklearn.tree import _tree
